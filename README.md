Software Project Management :
--------------------------------
A Software Project is the complete procedure of software development from requirement gathering to testing and maintenance, 
carried out according to the execution methodologies, in a specified period of time to achieve intended software product.

Need of software project management:
-------------------------------------
Software is said to be an intangible product. Software development is a kind of all new stream in world business and there’s 
very little experience in building software products. Most software products are tailor made to fit client’s requirements. 
The most important is that the underlying technology changes and advances so frequently and rapidly that experience of one product 
may not be applied to the other one. All such business and environmental constraints bring risk in software development hence it is 
essential to manage software projects efficiently.

Software Project Manager:
---------------------------
A software project manager is a person who undertakes the responsibility of executing the software project. Software project manager 
is thoroughly aware of all the phases of SDLC that the software would go through. Project manager may never directly involve in producing 
the end product but he controls and manages the activities involved in production.

A project manager closely monitors the development process, prepares and executes various plans, arranges necessary and adequate resources,
maintains communication among all team members in order to address issues of cost, budget, resources, time, quality and customer 
satisfaction.

Project Planning
Scope Management
Project Estimation


Project Planning
--------------------
Software project planning is task, which is performed before the production of software actually starts. It is there for the software production but involves no concrete activity that has any direction connection with software production; rather it is a set of multiple processes, which facilitates software production. Project planning may include the following:

Scope Management
------------------
It defines the scope of project; this includes all the activities, process need to be done in order to make a deliverable software product. Scope management is essential because it creates boundaries of the project by clearly defining what would be done in the project and what would not be done. This makes project to contain limited and quantifiable tasks, which can easily be documented and in turn avoids cost and time overrun.
	
During Project Scope management, it is necessary to -
----------------------------------------------------

Define the scope
Decide its verification and control
Divide the project into various smaller parts for ease of management.
Verify the scope
Control the scope by incorporating changes to the scope
