carried out according to the execution methodologies, in a specified period of time to achieve intended software product.

very little experience in building software products. Most software products are tailor made to fit client’s requirements.

may not be applied to the other one. All such business and environmental constraints bring risk in software development hence it is 
essential to manage software projects efficiently.

A software project manager is a person who undertakes the responsibility of executing the software project. Software project manager 
is thoroughly aware of all the phases of SDLC that the software would go through. Project manager may never directly involve in producing 
the end product but he controls and manages the activities involved in production.

maintains communication among all team members in order to address issues of cost, budget, resources, time, quality and customer 
satisfaction.
