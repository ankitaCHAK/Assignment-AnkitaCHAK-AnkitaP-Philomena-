Software Project Management :
--------------------------------
A Software Project is the complete procedure of software development from requirement gathering to testing and maintenance, 
carried out according to the execution methodologies, in a specified period of time to achieve intended software product.

Need of software project management:
-------------------------------------
Software is said to be an intangible product. Software development is a kind of all new stream in world business and there’s 
very little experience in building software products. Most software products are tailor made to fit client’s requirements. 
The most important is that the underlying technology changes and advances so frequently and rapidly that experience of one product 
may not be applied to the other one. All such business and environmental constraints bring risk in software development hence it is 
essential to manage software projects efficiently.

Software Project Manager:
---------------------------
A software project manager is a person who undertakes the responsibility of executing the software project. Software project manager 
is thoroughly aware of all the phases of SDLC that the software would go through. Project manager may never directly involve in producing 
the end product but he controls and manages the activities involved in production.

A project manager closely monitors the development process, prepares and executes various plans, arranges necessary and adequate resources,
maintains communication among all team members in order to address issues of cost, budget, resources, time, quality and customer 
satisfaction.

Software Management Activities
-----------------------------------
Software project management comprises of a number of activities, which contains planning of project, deciding scope of software product, estimation of cost in various terms, scheduling of tasks and events, and resource management. Project management activities may include:

Project Planning
Scope Management
Project Estimation


Project Planning
--------------------
Software project planning is task, which is performed before the production of software actually starts. It is there for the software production but involves no concrete activity that has any direction connection with software production; rather it is a set of multiple processes, which facilitates software production. Project planning may include the following:

Scope Management
------------------
It defines the scope of project; this includes all the activities, process need to be done in order to make a deliverable software product. Scope management is essential because it creates boundaries of the project by clearly defining what would be done in the project and what would not be done. This makes project to contain limited and quantifiable tasks, which can easily be documented and in turn avoids cost and time overrun.
	
During Project Scope management, it is necessary to -
----------------------------------------------------

Define the scope
Decide its verification and control
Divide the project into various smaller parts for ease of management.
Verify the scope
Control the scope by incorporating changes to the scope

Project Scheduling
-------------------

Project Scheduling in a project refers to roadmap of all activities to be done with specified order and within time slot allotted to each activity. Project managers tend to define various tasks, and project milestones and them arrange them keeping various factors in mind. They look for tasks lie in critical path in the schedule, which are necessary to complete in specific manner (because of task interdependency) and strictly within the time allocated. Arrangement of tasks which lies out of critical path are less likely to impact over all schedule of the project.

For scheduling a project, it is necessary to -
----------------------------------------------

Break down the project tasks into smaller, manageable form
Find out various tasks and correlate them
Estimate time frame required for each task
Divide time into work-units
Assign adequate number of work-units for each task
Calculate total time required for the project from start to finish

Resource management
---------------------
All elements used to develop a software product may be assumed as resource for that project. This may include human resource, productive tools and software libraries.

Resource management includes -
------------------------------

Defining proper organization project by creating a project team and allocating responsibilities to each team member

Determining resources required at a particular stage and their availability

Manage Resources by generating resource request when they are required and de-allocating them when they are no more needed.

Risk Management Process
------------------------
There are following activities involved in risk management process:

Identification- Make note of all possible risks, which may occur in the project.

Categorize - Categorize known risks into high, medium and low risk intensity as per their possible impact on the project.

Manage - Analyze the probability of occurrence of risks at various phases. Make plan to avoid or face risks. Attempt to minimize their side-effects.

Monitor - Closely monitor the potential risks and their early symptoms. Also monitor the effects of steps taken to mitigate or avoid them.
